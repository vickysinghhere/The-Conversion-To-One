You are given a number N. You need to convert it to 1 in minimum number of operations.

The operations allowed are as follows:

If N is even then divide the number by 2.
If N is odd then you can either add 1 to it or subtract 1 from it.
Using the above operations, find the minimum number of operations require to convert N to 1.

Input:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains 1 line of input containing N.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the minimum number of steps required.
